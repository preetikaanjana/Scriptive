## 🛠️ Contribution Workflow

### 🌿 Branching Strategy

- **`main`**: Production-ready code.
- **Feature Branches**: Use descriptive names like `feat/high-fidelity-ink` or `fix/safari-alignment`.
- Always branch off from `main`.

### 💾 Commit Message Guidelines

We follow **Conventional Commits**. This helps us generate clean changelogs automatically.
Format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`

**Common Types:**

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

### 🧪 Pull Request Process

1. **Lint and Format**: Run `npm run lint` before committing.
2. **Self-Review**: Look over your changes and remove any debugging code.
3. **Open PR**: Provide a detailed description of your changes, screenshots for UI modifications, and link any related issues.
4. **Review**: A maintainer will review your PR within 24-48 hours.

## 🎨 Coding Standards

- **TypeScript**: Ensure all new code is properly typed. Avoid `any`.
- **React**: Use functional components and hooks.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Use consistent spacing and color tokens.
- **Documentation**: Comment complex logic and update `README.md` if user-facing features change.
